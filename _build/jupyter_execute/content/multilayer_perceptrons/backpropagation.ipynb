    "# 2.6. Back Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation is the second step of the learning, which consists of injecting the error committed in the forward propagation phase (error while making predictions because the parameters are not completely trained yet) into the network in the reverse direction (from output layer to input layer) and update its parameters to perform better on the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the backpropagation algorithm is the workhorse of learning in neural networks. At the heart of backpropagation is an expression for the partial derivative of the cost function $J(W, b)$ with respect to weight $W$ (or bias $b$) in the network. The expression tells us how quickly the cost changes when we change the weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the optimization of the cost function $J(W, b)$ is needed and it is usually performed through a descent method. \n",

    "\n",
    "Backpropagation can be summarized using four different equations (vectorized form) considering the [notations presented in terminologies part-1](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/multilayer_perceptrons/terminologies_part_1.html#notations-to-be-used) (link to previous chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** For any layer $l$ ($l=1,2,...,L$), we call the `backpropagation error` ($\\delta_l$) in that layer as the partial derivative of the cost function $J(W, b)$ with respect to weighted sum of that layer $z_l$. That is:\n",
