    "# 2.10. Dropout regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "> The term `dropout` refers to randomly dropping out the neurons in a neural network (as seen in the figure below). At each training stage, individual neurons are either dropped out of the net with probability $p$ or kept with probability $1-p$, so that a reduced network is left. In testing phase, the entire network is considered and each activation is reduced by a factor $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is an approach to regularization in neural networks which helps reducing interdependent learning amongst the neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is `effective` especially when your **network is very big** or when you **train for a very long time**, both of which put a network at a higher risk of `overfitting`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have very large training data sets, the utility of regularization techniques, including dropout, declines because the network has more data available to learn to generalize better. \n",

    "During training phase, we trained the network with only a subset of the neurons. So during testing, we have to scale the output activations by factor of $p$, which means we have to modify the network during test phase. \n",

    "A simpler and commonly used alternative called `Inverted Dropout` scales the output activation during training phase by $\\frac{1}{p}$ so that we can leave the network during testing phase untouched.\n",
