    "# 4.3. Contextual Word Embeddings\n",

    "In order to understand what word embeddings are, why do we need it and what are traditional word embeddings, please visit [this page](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/word_embeddings/traditional_word_embeddings.html) (link to the previous chapter). \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in [static word embedding](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/word_embeddings/static_word_embeddings.html) (link to previous chapter), \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I will show you a valid **point** of reference and talk to the **point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Where have you placed the **point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now, for the [static word embeddings](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/word_embeddings/static_word_embeddings.html) (link to previous chapter) from a pre-trained embeddings such as [Word2Vec](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/word_embeddings/word2vec.html) (link to previous chapter), the embeddings for the word **point** is same for both of its occurrences in example-1 and also the same for the word **point** in example-2. All three occurrences has same embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are known as **Polysemous words** where the word use (e.g., syntax and\n",
    "semantics) depends on its `context`. So, why not learn the\n",
    "representations for each word in its context?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/point_contextual.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the concept of `Contextualized Word Embeddings` came into the picture, which returns different embeddings for the same word depending on the words around it â€” its embeddings are **context-sensitive**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would actually return different answers for **point** in both of these examples because it would recognize that the word is being used in different contexts. Let us explore further different types of **contextualized word embeddings**.\n",
